## Raw Data?
When you take a test sold by AncestryDNA, 23andMe, or FamilyTreeDNA, your genome is sequenced. The information shown to you by these companies is just a small portion of what is actually sequenced. Many people aren't aware of this, but you are able to download the genetic information that the testing company has collected in the form of a .txt file.

The .txt file contains a very long list of what seems like nonsensical numbers and letters, but these are the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been identified in your genome. Each of these SNPs represents a germline substitution where a single nucleotide is replaced at a specific position in the genome. These SNPs and their nucleotides have been extensively studied throughout the years and many have been linked to certain health conditions, physical traits, personality, skills, and more.

To download a copy of your raw data, follow the steps below.
